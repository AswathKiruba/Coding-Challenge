    "\n",
    "`INSERT INTO TABLE department PARTITION (deptname='XYZ')`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:** fast\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitions are created when data is inserted into table. Depending on how you load data you would need partitions. Usually when loading files (big files) into Hive tables static partitions are preferred. That saves your time in loading data compared to dynamic partition. You \"statically\" add a partition in table and move the file into the partition of the table. Since the files are big they are usually generated in HDFS. You can get the partition column value form the filename, day of date etc without reading the whole big file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Allowing the table create the partitions dynamically based on the values inserted to the column which the user defined as a partition column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Same create statement. But `set hive.exec.dynamic.partition=true`\n",
    "and `set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode = nonstrict` (disables the restriction on creating a table with atleast one static partition)\n",
    "\n",
    "`INSERT INTO TABLE  department PARTITION (deptname)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantage** slow\n",
    "\n",
    "Incase of dynamic partition whole big file i.e. every row of the data is read and data is partitioned through a MR job into the destination tables depending on certain field in file. So usually dynamic partition are useful when you are doing sort of a ETL flow in your data pipeline. e.g. you load a huge file through a move command into a Table X. then you run a inert query into a Table Y and partition data based on field in table X say day , country. You may want to further run a ETL step to partition the data in country partition in Table Y into a Table Z where data is partitioned based on cities for a particular country only. etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus depending on your end table or requirements for data and in what form data is produced at source you may choose static or dynamic partition."
