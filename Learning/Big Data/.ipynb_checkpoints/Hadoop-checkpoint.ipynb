    "In 2013, Hadoop's MapReduce was divided into 2\n",

    "# Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "### HDFS\n",
    "Hadoop is deployed on a group of machine (refered as cluster). Each machine in the cluster is called as node.\n",
    "* **Name node**: acts as mster node. manages overall file system.\n",
    "    * It stores the directory structure\n",
    "    * Metadata for all the files (block locations of each file)\n",
    "* **Data node**: data is physically stored in name nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "For example a file is broken into blocks of size 128 MB.\n",
    "**How is the size choosed?**\n",
    "Aimed to minimize the time to seek the block on the disk. Once seeked we could read the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps on reading a File**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The metadata in name node (its referred first)\n",
    "2. The blocks in the data node\n",
    "\n",
    "**What if one of the blocks get corrupted or what happens when a node fail?**\n",
    "Solution: replication factor. Copy the blocks in different node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MapReduce\n",
    "\n",
    "**Find the number of time hello has occured in the file**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Map Phase**: Process each block in the node that its stored and get intermediate results.\n",
    "2. **Reduce Phase**: Take all the results to one node and combine them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### YARN\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yet another resource negotiator**\n",
    "1. Resposible for the management of resources on the Hadoop cluster.\n",
    "2. Monitor failures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different modes\n",
    "1. Standalone mode: only one node (technically no HDFS, no YARN)\n",
    "2. Pseudo-distributed: two nodes are running,one acts as a name node and other as a data node\n",
    "3. Fully distributed: Manually configuring and managing nodes in a Hadoop cluster is complicated and error-prone. We could use enterprise edition of Hadoop: Cloudera, Hortonworks"

    "\n",
    "We could also chain transformations.\n",

    "\n",
    "Instead of sending the mapper results to a single node to perform sort/merge we could use the combiner function to merge/combine the key value pairs with the same keys.\n",
